Replace 1.jpg in the folder with a background image named 1.jpg. Do the same for the rest of the images and your background images will show up randomly in the login/signup pages.\n\n\n\nFurther Resources\n===\n\nBe sure to checkout our forums here <a href="http://forums.devdojo.com/conversations/ninja-media-script" target="_blank">http://forums.devdojo.com/conversations/ninja-media-script</a>\nAnd our Support Center here <a href="http://devdojo.ticksy.com" target="_blank">http://devdojo.ticksy.com</a>';
